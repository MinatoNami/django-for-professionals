## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by chapter, with each major example or project contained in its own directory following the book's progression.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Basic understanding of Django and Python

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MinatoNami/django-for-professionals.git
cd django-for-professionals
```

### Docker-Based Development

The book emphasizes Docker for consistent development environments:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker-compose up -d --build

# Run migrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

# Access the application
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000
```

### Local Development (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run without Docker:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run development server
python manage.py runserver
```

## Key Topics Covered

Based on the book's curriculum, this repository demonstrates:

1. **Docker Setup** - Containerized development environment
2. **PostgreSQL** - Production-grade database configuration
3. **Custom User Model** - Best practice user authentication
4. **User Authentication** - Login, logout, signup flows
5. **Bootstrap Styling** - Professional UI/UX
6. **Password Management** - Reset and change functionality
7. **Email Configuration** - Production email setup
8. **Static Assets** - WhiteNoise and production static files
9. **Advanced User Registration** - Email confirmation workflows
10. **Environment Variables** - Secure configuration management
11. **Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage
12. **Performance** - Optimization and security hardening
13. **Deployment** - Production deployment strategies

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/dbname
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
```

### Database

The project uses PostgreSQL by default (configured via Docker Compose). Update `docker-compose.yml` or your `.env` file to configure database credentials.

## Running Tests

```bash
# With Docker
docker-compose exec web python manage.py test

# Without Docker
python manage.py test
```

## Production Deployment

The book covers deployment to various platforms. Key production considerations:

- Set `DEBUG=False`
- Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` properly
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Set up proper database backups
- Configure email backend
- Use HTTPS/SSL certificates
- Run `collectstatic` for static files
- Use a production WSGI server (Gunicorn)
